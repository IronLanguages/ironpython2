"""This test case provides support for checking forking and wait behavior.

To test different wait behavior, override the wait_impl method.

We want fork1() semantics -- only the forking thread survives in the
child after a fork().

On some systems (e.g. Solaris without posix threads) we find that all
active threads survive in the child after a fork(); this is an error.

While BeOS doesn't officially support fork and native threading in
the same application, the present example should work just fine.  DC
